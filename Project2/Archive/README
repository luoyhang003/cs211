For Part 1, you need to use following command to compile the program:

    g++ -o run part1.cpp -I/opt/lapack/include /opt/lapack/lib/liblapacke.a /opt/lapack/lib/liblapack.a /opt/lapack/lib/librefblas.a -lgfortran -lm -lrt

And use './run <num>' to run the program. Please note that the program needs a parameter which represents the size of the matrix.

For Part 2, you need to use following command to compile the program:

    g++ -o run part2.cpp

And use './run' to run the program.

And 'mylu,m' and 'test.m' are MATLAB files, you need run them in MATLAB.

'part2_findblocknum.cpp' is the file that I use to find the proper block size during optimizing the performance.
